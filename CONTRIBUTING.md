# Contributing to Game On!

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

## Create issues...

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it.

### ...but check for existing issues first!

Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

## Coding standards and Conventions

There are a few different projects in the repo, in a few different languages. Most have .editorconfig files. Java projects built with Gradle include changes to eclipse project settings for consistent formatting of Java files.

In general, uses spaces, not tabs. 4 spaces for Java, and 2 spaces for just about everything else. Opening braces should be on the same line, with the closing brace on its own line, unless the block is empty or for else clauses.


### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the commit message
which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you
can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):
```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.

San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then you just add a line to end of the git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>

using your real name. Sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.

Many Git UI tools have support for adding the `Signed-off-by` line to the end of your commit
message. This line can be automatically added by the `git commit` command by using the `-s` option.
